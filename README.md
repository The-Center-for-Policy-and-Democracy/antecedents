Abstract
Most studies of policy change within the ACF have been descriptive, single-instance explorations that confirm one or more of its four pathways: external shocks, internal shocks, negotiated agreements, and policy-oriented learning. To advance ACF studies of policy change, this chapter takes a different approach to assessing the drivers of change. Rather than looking to confirm one of the four pathway, we inductively explore what policy actor’s accredit to policy change as its ‘antecedent’. We observe antecedents through policy actor references mentioned in the public discourse surrounding the policy changes for 77 policies within the Colorado oil and gas subsystem between 2007 – 2021within public and government documents, public testimony, and news articles. These inductive antecedents of each policy change were then categorized into xxx and then later compared with the four pathways of change outlined within the ACF. We find internal references were the most common antecedent among the 77 policy changes, followed by external references. We conclude by discussing the significance of these results for studying policy change and the existing pathways and contribute methods and guidelines for conducting a medium-sized analysis of policy change over time.

Methods:

We define antecedents as an expression by a policy actor in the public discourse of anything that happens before the policy change and is somehow linked to policy change through their language. Some of these examples include explicit language (e.g., using phrases such as “because of,” “as a result of,” “led to,”), while other examples include inferences of how people understood the reasoning for policy change. Examples of antecedents can include (but are not limited to) references to events, responses from other governments, citing new information, citing prior policy decisions, and more. As described below, this is a new data collection approach, using both induction and deduction. We maintain a wide net in collecting antecedents, but this net is loosely structured by common categories in the literature, including the ACF and beyond. After the data collection, we revisit the data with more refined theoretical categories to prompt analysis (see rounds of coding below).

To understand policy actors’ expressions of antecedents in the public discourse, we code how they describe their understanding of why a policy changes within any part of the policy process. This approach does not allow us to identify “objective” data or independent variables that can be modeled causally in explaining policy change. However, we are observing antecedents that people specify themselves in the public discourse. Thus, data may reflect their strategies and objectives in framing the rationale for the policy change, their efforts to make sense of the policy change, the focus of their attention, and more. This approach gives insights into how policy actors construct their view of policy change and what they see as important (not what we as researchers deem important).


Our identification and coding of antecedents leverages both an inductive and deductive approach. We maintain a wide net in collecting antecedents, but we code them according to common categories in the literature on policy change, including the ACF and beyond. We engaged in three rounds of coding with several ICR tests throughout to develop more refined theoretical categories. 

Round 1. We coded each policy for basic characteristics, including purpose, venue, and date of proposal and passage.
Round 2. We identified an antecedent when we read or heard specific evidence of an actor saying or inferring why or what led to a policy change or when we read specific antecedents that were included in the scope or motivation of policy documents. We coded written and audio statements containing antecedents using a qualitative software (atlas.ti) as well as descriptively in Excel.  
Round 3. We categorized the coded antecedents into two broad categories (either an external or internal reference) and several sub-categories. External antecedents refer to something outside the subsystem’s scope either substantively or geographically, while internal antecedents refer to something inside the policy subsystem’s scope either substantively or geographically. For the subcategories, we relied partly on the existing subcategories of internal and external events in the ACF and partly on what finding the common categories of themes. These subcategories were categorized inductively through coding the antecedents and by teams of researchers for ICR.  They can be found in the volume’s supplemental material (or with results in table 1).  

As we coded, we paid particular attention to the context for this particular subsystem. For instance, Governor Hickenlooper, who was in office between 2011-2019, crafted several executive orders and spearheaded many policy changes, often interacting as a policy broker with advocacy groups on various sides of the issue and with regulatory agencies (Heikkila et al., 2014). Due to his close relationship with the oil and gas subsystem, we coded his involvement as internal.

In coding the antecedents, our inductive approach minded the broad arguments of policy change found across the literature. This includes, for example, path dependency, policy feedback, policy diffusion, conflict, policy entrepreneurs, and more. Throughout our rounds of coding, we were guided by the antecedents identified by our actors and our goal was to ensure a complete collection of antecedents as possible and not exclude something just because the ACF said it was not important.
